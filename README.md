# Haskell Student Management Program

This project is the result of a college assignment, where the objective was to explore the functional programming paradigm using a purely functional language.
It consists of a Haskell application designed to manage student records efficiently. It provides functionality for processing student data, such as calculating averages and generating reports, with a focus on functional programming principles.
